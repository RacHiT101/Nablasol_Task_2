1. The test is designed to help understand your Front-end Development Skills using a JavaScript framework.
2. Please store the data in browser's local storage and add validation as needed.
3. We expect the output to be responsive and work across different devices.
4. While doing the tasks, use the common UI/UX principles while converting the designs to modern functional pages.
5. There are layouts for 2 different tasks whose designs have been provided as image files. 

TASK 1:
It's a 6-step form and you can complete any 4 steps. [Reference images: Task1a.png, Task1b.png, Task1c.png]

TASK 2:
It's a 3-step form and you need to build the first 2. [Reference images: Task2a.png, Task2b.png]


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
These tasks mimic the kind of work you’d be doing on a daily basis while on the job. It is imperative that you follow the academic honor code and complete these tasks on your own, without taking any help from another person. This is essential because this will help us evaluate how successful you’ll be in this role and we’re sure you definitely do not want to signup for a job where you won’t be successful.
